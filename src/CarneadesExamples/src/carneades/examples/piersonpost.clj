;; The Pierson vs. Post case.  Used to illustrate the use of
;;   a scheme for "practical reasoning" in legal argument.
;; See Atkinson, Bench-Capon, McBurney, "Arguing About Cases
;;  as Practical Reasoning",  ICAIL05.  The following is a recontruction
;; of the arguments in the published opinion, not a reconstruction
;; of the reconstruction in Katie's, Trevor's and Peter's paper. 

;; The full text of the decision can be found at:

These installation instructions are for the Carneades inference engine,
implemented in the Clojure programming language.


1. Prerequisites

- The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 <http://java.sun.com/>
- Leiningen <http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen>


2. Downloading Carneades

Carneades is available for downloading from
	<http://carneades.berlios.de>  

Alternatively, the sources can be downloaded using either the SVN or the Bazaar source code management system:

	$ svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/carneades/trunk
	$ bzr branch lp:~vcs-imports/carneades/trunk

        
3. Installation

- First create a directory for the sources.  We'll refer to this
directory below as CARNEADES_HOME.  (You do not need to create an 
environment variable with this name.)

- Change directory to CARNEADES_HOME.

- Unpack the zip file in this directory.

- Change directory to CARNEADES_HOME/clojure/CarneadesEngine

- Resolve dependencies:

$ lein deps nodev

or if you want to use the swank server for Emacs and SLIME with leiningen:

$ lein deps


4. Trying it out

- Run the tests

$ lein test

- With the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):

$ lein repl

And then type, for instance to test the Pierson-Post example:
(use :reload-all 'carneades.examples.piersonpost)

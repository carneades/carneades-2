  A candidate argument is an argument which might have uninstantiated
  variables. The candidate argument is asserted into an argument graph
  of a state only when the guard is ground in the substitution environment
  of the state, by substituting all the variables in the argument with
  their values in the substitution environment.  If the guard is correct,
  the argument put forward will contain only ground statements,
  i.e. with no variables.

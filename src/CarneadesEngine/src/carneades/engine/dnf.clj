(ns ^{:doc "This library is implemented to convert every logical formula into an
            equivalent 'disjunctive normalform' (DNF). A DNF is a disjunction of a
            conjunction of literals.
            You can find a more detailed, that is a more mathematic, description of
            logical formulas below.
            DNF is the only way, the 'rule'-library can handle logical formulas.
            To support every valid formula, it is converted, before used.
            The algorithm used to convert the formulas to DNF runs through two main
            steps:
              - negations are only allowed before atoms (only in literals)
                  (not (not t1)) -> t1
                  (not (and t1 t2) -> (or (not t1) (not t2))
                  (not (or t1 t2) -> (and (not t1) (not t2))
              - usage of distributivity to bring inner disjunctions to an outer level
                  (and t1 (or t2 t3)) -> (or (and t1 t2) (and t1 t3))
                  (and (or t1 t2) t3) -> (or (and t1 t3) (and t2 t3))
            Before these steps could be run through, equivalences have to be substituted
            for implications, which themselves have to be substituted for disjunctions.
            You do not need to care, if you only use the 'to-dnf' method.
            
            The library was extended to the use of the predicates 'assuming' and
            'unless'.
            These extensions were made in order to distinguish special rules for burden
            of proof.
            Throughout the conversions the predicates are handled as identity and
            negation.
            
            !!! BEWARE !!!
            Worst case conversion includes exponential time complexity. For example,
            a conversion from CNF to DNF with n variables could induce 2^n operations.
            As this library is especially designed for the 'rules'-library and these
            rules won't be too long, this is ok for 'carneades' to still run quick.
